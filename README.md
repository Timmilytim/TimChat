This a Chat Application code created with JavaFx

You might be wondering what JavaFX is, so I'll give little details about it.
JavaFX is a set of Java graphics libraries and tools for building rich desktop applications with a modern graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a framework for creating cross-platform applications that can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. JavaFX is designed to replace the older Swing framework for building Java desktop applications.

In one sentence it is the GUI version of writing our JAVA codes.

This code is not yet complete though, but the application is working fine..
